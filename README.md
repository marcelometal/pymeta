## OMeta

"OMeta is a new object-oriented language for pattern matching. It is based on
a variant of Parsing Expression Grammars (PEGs) which we have extended to
handle arbitrary data types. OMeta's general-purpose pattern matching
facilities provide a natural and convenient way for programmers to implement
tokenizers, parsers, visitors, and tree transformers, all of which can be
extended in interesting ways using familiar object-oriented mechanisms."
